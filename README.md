## 4. Timeline
Project start to end: Jul - Sep 2024

## 5. Scope of Work
BrainGPT is an AI-powered tool designed to assist beginners and educators in exploring quantitative trading research by decomposing trading ideas, formulating mathematical models, and generating predictive expressions for US equities. It leverages OpenAI API and WorldQuant BRAIN API to streamline the alpha construction process, enhancing accessibility and learning in quantitative finance research.

## 6. Process and Approach
**Input**: Trading ideas for US equities markets.  
**Output**: Structured mathematical expressions and predictive models for alpha construction, suitable for beginner-level research and educational purposes.  
**Process and Features**:  
- **AI-Assisted Modeling**: Uses OpenAI API fine-tuned (GPT-4o) to decompose trading ideas and generate structured predictive expressions.  
- **WorldQuant BRAIN API Integration**: Pulls financial data to support alpha development and testing.  
- **Prompt Engineering**: Employs systematic instructions to ensure reliable and consistent AI outputs for novice users.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies complex quantitative processes for educational use, guiding users through alpha formulation.  
- **Scalable Testing**: Supports rapid iteration and testing of alpha expressions in a controlled environment.

## 7. Outcome
Contributing to our National Champion title at the International Quant Championship 2024, showcase project MVP at Singapore Global Final Round. The toolâ€™s outputs, including structured alpha expressions, were used for educational purposes and beginner-level research, as documented in our project repository (https://github.com/yourprofile/brain-gpt).
